                            <h2>FAQ!</h2>
                            <span class="faq-header"> Let’s begin by asking, who are you and what you do?</span>
                                I am a web enthusiast and in love with the possibilities that web apps have provided us in the recent times!
                                My first interaction with the web was during my school time at Delhi Public School Ghaziabad and it continues till date.
                                I hold an engineering degree in Electronics and Communication from Amity University and currently I am part of Wipro Technologies,
                                Hyderabad where my role is of a Test Engineer and we work with Microsoft to help build better and bug free products <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
                            <span class="faq-header"> What does an average day hold for you? </span>
                            My daily musings include <em>Learning to breathe, trying to get wings to fly! :P </em> I have varied interests with ranges from 
                            writing, coding, soldering to cooking  and reading comics {addict alert!} depending on the mood and time frame.
                            <span class="faq-header"> Any specific reason for making this website? </span>
                            Internet has always been a very fascinating topic for me and I wanted to have some space that belongs to me under this sun!
                            This is an attempt to jump start the process. Also working on projects
                            like these helps you understand a lot of concepts in a much better way and I can very delightfully say that after the
                            completion of flashspark.in, I am a more learned man!
                            <span class="faq-header">You say, you like the potential of web. What about web attracts you? </span>
                            The evolution of web in the last decade (the approximate amount of the time, I have been its user!)
                            has been almost exmplerary. It has truly shrunk the boundaries in every conceivable way.
                            We have already began our journey into the new era where virtual world is not confined to a handful of devices!
                            <span class="faq-header">Tell us about the tools and technologies you are comfortable with?</span>
                            I learnt a good deal about Oracle and Visual Basic during my school time.
                            By the time I joined my college, I was very much interested in learning semiconductor devices
                            and focussed on the same but kept my interest for web going, by learning wordpress and drupal.
                            Now I work with ASP.NET, MVC, SQL Server,HTML5, JQuery, CSS 3, Angular JS and SVG.
                            <span class="faq-header">Why is there no copyright notice on this website?</span>
                            Aha! Its like the 1st law of thermodynamics!!<em> Knowledge cannot be created or destroyed, it just changes from brain to another! </em>
                            Whatever I have used in this website or the ideas I have presented have been polished using the internet only,
                            so everything is open for redistribution! All I ask, is that if there is something interesting, please contact me as I might be able to contribute more!
                            <span class="faq-header">Finally, who came up with this douchy idea of interviewing yourself!</span>
                            Hey! Well, after completing this section, it does looks a bit pompous! I guess, one of the perks of making your own webpage :P.
